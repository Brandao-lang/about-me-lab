      <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>
        After high school I attended Brookdale Community College located in
        Lincroft, New Jeresy. I initially aimed to major in nursing but pivoted
        to business administration. I then went to Rutgers Univerisity. At
        Rutgers I majored in information technology and decided I would aim my
        career path tpwards web development.

      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <p>
        My hobbies include playing the bass guitar, practicing code, spending
        time with my friends, and reading. I started playing bass around 2 years
        ago. I was introduced to the instrument through my local church where I
        went on to play for the worship service.

      <h1>Goals</h1>
      <p>
        As for future goals I aim to become a web developer for an organization
        where I can create, maintain, and update company or client websites.
        Half way through my academic career at Rutgers I discovered web
        development and have been pursuing it ever since. I am currently in the
        Dev Mountain web development cohort where I am striving to achieve this
        goal of mine.
